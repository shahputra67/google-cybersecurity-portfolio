# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review an example of a final report and answer quiz questions.

You have learned about the Post-incident Activity phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle. This phase includes developing a final report, which documents a comprehensive review of an incident, including all events and recommendations for future prevention.

## Scenario

You recently joined the security team as a level-one SOC analyst at a mid-sized retail company. The company operates both physical stores and e-commerce, which accounts for 80% of sales.

A recent major security incident involved a data breach affecting over one million users. Your team is reviewing the incident to prevent similar events. The breach occurred before your employment. You are tasked with reviewing the final report.

### Review Goals

2. Identify when it happened.  
3. Identify the response actions taken.  
4. Identify future recommendations.  

**Note:** Use your incident handler's journal from a previous activity to take notes.
