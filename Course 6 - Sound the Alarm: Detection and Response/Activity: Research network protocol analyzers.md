# Activity Overview

In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. The goal is to understand how they work, their features, and how they differ and overlap.  

A network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) captures and analyzes data traffic within a network. These tools help security analysts examine and understand network traffic flows.

## Scenario

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are asked to research the differences and similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump and create a chart summarizing your findings.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template

1. Click the link provided and select **Use Template**.  
2. If you do not have a Google account, download the template attachment directly.  

### Step 2: Research Wireshark and tcpdump

Use official documentation and reliable resources:

- [tcpdump - Resources and documentation](https://www.tcpdump.org/)  
- [Wireshark - Official User Guide](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/)  

Search for additional resources using terms like:

- "Wireshark features and functionalities"  
- "tcpdump features and functionalities"  
- "comparison between tcpdump and Wireshark"  

Focus on reliable sources such as official documentation, reputable cybersecurity sites, or technical forums.

### Step 3: Compare Features

Consider these questions:

- What software or equipment is required? Is the tool open-source or proprietary?  
- What type of user interface does the tool use?  
- How do security analysts use it? What are recommended usage scenarios?  
- How does it capture, analyze, and filter traffic?  
- Are there limitations or considerations for using the tool?  

### Step 4: Fill Out the Template

1. Include at least two features for each tool. These can be:

   - Tool capabilities  
   - Type of analysis  
   - Contrasting features  
   - User interfaces  
   - Usage scenarios  

2. Include three similarities between tcpdump and Wireshark.

### Step 5: Save the Template

Save a blank copy of the template for future practice or professional projects. This helps demonstrate your workflow and experience.

## What to Include in Your Response

- At least 2 differences between Wireshark and tcpdump  
- At least 3 similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump
