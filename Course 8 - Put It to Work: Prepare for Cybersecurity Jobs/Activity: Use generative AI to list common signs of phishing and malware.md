# Activity: Use Generative AI to List Common Signs of Phishing and Malware

## Overview
The lesson videos showed Luis tackling a range of responsibilities in his cybersecurity role at Google. Cybersecurity professionals also often safeguard devices and networks from phishing emails and malware, and educate users about these threats. Generative AI (gen AI) can help make this critical routine task faster and more efficient. In this activity, you’ll use a gen AI tool and the TCREI prompting framework to identify and list common signs of phishing and malware in emails. This activity is optional, but we recommend it to help you level up your prompting skills. If you’re unable to complete this activity, you’ll still be able to progress through the course and earn a certificate from Google.

## Steps

Important: Do not enter private or confidential information when using AI tools.

Use the TCREI Prompting Framework

Task: Define what you want the AI to do.

Context: Provide background or purpose.

References: Include examples or guidelines.

Evaluate: Review the output for accuracy and clarity.

Iterate: Refine your prompt to improve the result.

Your Task

Run your prompt in the AI tool and review the response.

Adjust your prompt until the output meets your goal.

Answer the Questions

### Question 1: Select which parts of the prompting framework were most useful.
Answer:
✅ Task (including persona and format)
✅ Context
✅ Evaluate
✅ Iterate

### Question 2: Submit the prompt that produced your best output.
Answer: You are a cybersecurity analyst responsible for training employees on email security. Create a clear and detailed list of common signs that indicate a phishing or malware email. Include both technical and behavioral indicators, such as suspicious URLs, unexpected attachments, and social engineering tactics. Provide short explanations for each sign to help employees understand why it’s risky. Present the output in bullet points. Use up-to-date examples when possible.

### Question 3: In 1–2 sentences, explain how evaluating and iterating changed or improved your final result.
Answer: Evaluating helped refine the response by identifying missing points like sender address manipulation and urgency tactics. Iterating improved clarity and organization, resulting in a more complete and practical list that better supports employee awareness training.
