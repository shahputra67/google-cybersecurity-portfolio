# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will assess the access controls used by a business. You’ll analyze their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations to improve their security practices.

Access controls are security measures that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication verifies who a user is, while authorization defines what that user is allowed to do. Strong access control reduces the likelihood of security incidents and unauthorized activity.

## Scenario

You are the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.  

Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager denied making this transaction, but it was stopped in time. The owner has asked you to investigate the issue to prevent it from happening again.  

You will review the access log, take notes about a potential threat actor, identify weaknesses in access controls, and recommend improvements to strengthen the company’s security posture.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
Use the following template to complete this activity.  
- Click the provided **Access control worksheet** link and select “Use Template”.  
- If you don’t have a Google account, download the file directly from the attachment.

### Step 2: Access Supporting Materials
Use the **Accounting exercise** spreadsheet as supporting material.  
This file contains two tabs:
1. **Event log** – details of the payroll incident  
2. **Employee directory** – information about company staff  

Keep both tabs open while completing the next steps.

### Step 3: Review the Event Log
Event logs record actions and system usage. They help identify suspicious activity, track users, and detect vulnerabilities.

- Open the **Event log** tab in the Accounting exercise.  
- Review details such as **Event Type**, **Date**, **Time**, and **IP Address**.  
- Write **1–2 notes** in the **Notes** column of your Access control worksheet about what you learned about the user based on these details.

---

### Step 4: Identify Access Control Issues
Compare information between the **Event log** and **Employee directory** tabs.  
Look for overlaps that suggest potential misuse or access issues.

- Note **1–2 issues** related to how the company manages access, such as:  
  - Shared accounts  
  - Lack of access revocation for former employees  
  - Weak or missing authentication methods  

Record these in the **Issues** column of your Access control worksheet.

---

### Step 5: Recommend Mitigations
Provide **at least two recommendations** to help the business improve its access control system.  
Examples include:  
- Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Assigning unique accounts to each employee  
- Revoking access when employees leave the company  
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)  

Write these recommendations in the **Recommendation(s)** column of your Access control worksheet.
