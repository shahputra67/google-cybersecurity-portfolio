# Activity Instructions: Home Office Asset Classification

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a **home office network**.  
Asset management is a key part of an organization’s security strategy. It involves identifying, tracking, and protecting all assets connected to a network. The first step is to create an **asset inventory** to know what needs protection. Then, classify each asset based on how important and sensitive it is.

## Scenario

You operate a small business from home and need to create an inventory of devices connected to your home network.  
Your setup includes a **desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and an external hard drive**. Each device can be a potential entry point for attackers. An organized asset inventory will help you determine which devices need stronger protection.

To complete this task:
- Identify **three devices** connected to your home network.  
- Record their **characteristics**, such as owner, location, and network access level.  
- Assign each device a **sensitivity level** based on how critical it is to your business.

Common devices may include:
- Desktop or laptop computers  
- Smartphones  
- Smart home devices  
- Game consoles  
- Storage devices or servers  
- Video streaming devices

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
Open the **Home Asset Inventory** template using the provided link and click **Use Template**.  
If you don’t have a Google account, download the template directly from the attachment.

### Step 2: Identify Assets
In the **Asset** column of the spreadsheet:
1. Look at the devices already listed (e.g., router, desktop, guest smartphone).  
2. Add **three new devices** that are connected to your home network.  
Use the scenario graphic as a reference if available.

### Step 3: Fill in Device Characteristics
For each identified device, fill in the following columns:
- **Network Access:** How often the device connects to the network.  
- **Owner:** Who owns or manages the device.  
- **Location:** Where the device is physically located in relation to the router.

Example:
- Device: Laptop  
- Network Access: Daily  
- Owner: Business Owner  
- Location: Home Office

### Step 4: Evaluate the Access of Network Devices
In the **Notes** column, add one or two key details about each device.  
Use these guiding questions:
- What type of information is stored on the device?  
- How does it connect to the network?  
- Is the owner careful about securing it?

Example:
- The desktop computer stores confidential business documents and connects via Ethernet.  
- The router separates smart home devices from personal devices using two frequencies.

Your notes should reflect factors that could affect the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, or **availability** of network information.

### Step 5: Classify Device Sensitivity
Use your notes to classify each device’s sensitivity in the **Sensitivity** column.  
Think about how security issues could affect your business:
- What data could be disclosed or stolen?  
- Could an attacker change or damage the information?  
- What would happen if the data were destroyed?

Use the standard sensitivity categories:
- **Public:** Information is available to anyone.  
- **Internal:** Restricted to internal users.  
- **Confidential:** Access limited to specific people.  
- **Highly Confidential:** Access restricted to only essential personnel.

Example:
- The network router might be **Confidential** since access is limited to authorized users.  
- The external hard drive might be **Highly Confidential** if it stores backups of client data.

## What to Include in Your Response
Your completed activity should include:
- A **list of three devices** on the home network  
- **Network access, owner, and location** for each device  
- **1–2 notes** describing network access or stored information  
- A **sensitivity classification** for each device
