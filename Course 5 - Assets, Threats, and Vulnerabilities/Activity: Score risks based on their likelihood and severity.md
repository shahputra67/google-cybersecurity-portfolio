## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will perform a **risk assessment** by evaluating vulnerabilities that threaten business operations. You will assign **likelihood** and **severity scores** to each vulnerability, then calculate a total **risk score** to help prioritize mitigation efforts.

Risk assessment is part of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, which guides organizations in managing cybersecurity risks. This process helps determine whether security operations are strong enough to prevent attacks and protect sensitive data.

## Scenario

You recently joined the cybersecurity team at a **commercial bank**. The team is conducting a **risk assessment** of the bank’s operational environment and maintaining a **risk register** to record and prioritize potential risks.

A **risk register** is a document that tracks risks, their likelihood, severity, and mitigation plans. Your task is to evaluate five key risks that threaten the bank’s funds and determine how to prioritize them.

### Operating Environment
The bank’s characteristics:
- Located in a **coastal area** with **low crime rates**
- Staff includes **100 on-premise employees** and **20 remote employees**
- **2,000 individual accounts** and **200 commercial accounts**
- Partners with a **sports team** and **local businesses**
- Must comply with **strict financial regulations** and maintain daily fund requirements set by the Federal Reserve

### Risks to Bank Funds
The cybersecurity team identified five major risks:
1. Business email compromise  
2. Compromised user database  
3. Financial records leak  
4. Theft  
5. Supply chain attack  

Your task is to evaluate these risks by:
- Writing a short explanation of how security events are possible in this environment  
- Scoring each risk based on **likelihood**, **severity**, and **priority**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
Open the **Risk Register** template using the provided link and click **Use Template**.  
If you do not have a Google account, download the template from the attachment.

---

### Step 2: Review the Operating Environment
Examine how the bank’s characteristics might influence its risk exposure.  
Consider both **human and environmental factors** such as:
- Employee access to financial systems  
- Remote connections and data transfers  
- Natural hazards like hurricanes in a coastal area  
- Compliance with banking regulations  

Write **2–3 sentences (40–60 words)** in the **Notes** area of the template summarizing how these risks could lead to security incidents in the bank’s environment.

Example:  
“The bank operates with many users accessing sensitive financial systems daily, which increases the risk of data breaches or email compromise. Being located in a coastal area also introduces environmental risks such as power outages that may disrupt services.”

### Step 3: Assign Likelihood Scores
Estimate how likely each risk is to occur based on the environment and typical industry threats.  
Use this scale:

| Score | Likelihood Description |
|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | Low – Rare occurrence |
| 2 | Moderate – Possible occurrence |
| 3 | High – Frequent or expected occurrence |

Examples:
- **Business email compromise** may score **3** due to regular communication with partners.  
- **Supply chain attack** may score **1** since it depends on rare third-party failures.

Enter your scores in the **Likelihood** column of the risk register.

---

### Step 4: Assign Severity Scores
Determine how severe each risk’s impact would be if it occurred. Consider:
- Financial loss or theft  
- Data breaches or record leaks  
- Regulatory fines or violations  
- Reputational harm  
- Business disruption  

Use this scale:

| Score | Severity Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | Low – Minimal impact |
| 2 | Moderate – Noticeable but manageable impact |
| 3 | High – Serious or catastrophic impact |

Examples:
- A **financial records leak** might score **3** due to loss of trust and legal penalties.  
- **Theft** might score **2** if limited funds are affected but operations continue.

Record your severity scores in the **Severity** column.

---

### Step 5: Calculate Risk Priority
Use the formula:

**Likelihood × Severity = Risk Priority**

This score ranges from **1–9** and helps prioritize which risks to address first.

Examples:
- Business email compromise: 3 × 3 = **9 (High Priority)**  
- Supply chain attack: 1 × 2 = **2 (Low Priority)**  

Enter the calculated values in the **Priority** column of the risk register.

---

## What to Include in Your Response
Your completed activity must include:

- **2–3 sentences** describing the risk factors in the operating environment  
- **Five likelihood scores** (1–3 scale)  
- **Five severity scores** (1–3 scale)  
- **Five calculated risk scores** (1–9 scale)
