# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will assess the attack vectors of a USB drive. You will analyze a scenario involving a USB drive found in a parking lot from the perspective of both an attacker and a target.

USB drives are convenient for storing and transferring data, but they also pose security risks. Threat actors often use them to spread malware, damage systems, or gain control of devices. A common attack, known as **USB baiting**, relies on curiosity—an attacker leaves an infected USB stick for someone to find and plug into a computer, unknowingly infecting the network.

## Scenario

You are part of the security team at **Rhetorical Hospital**.  
One morning, you find a USB stick in the parking lot with the hospital’s logo. No one is around, so you pick it up and bring it to your office.  

Your team uses virtualization software to safely investigate unknown USB devices. This setup isolates the USB from the main system, preventing any malicious files from spreading if the device is infected.

When examined, the USB drive appears to belong to **Jorge Bailey**, the Human Resources Manager. It contains a mix of personal and work-related files, including family photos, a new hire letter, and an employee shift schedule.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
To complete this activity:
- Click the **Parking lot USB exercise** link and select **Use Template**.  
- If you don’t have a Google account, download the attachment directly.

---

### Step 2: Examine the USB Contents
Review the folders and files stored on the USB.  
In the **Contents** row of your activity template, write **2–3 sentences (40–60 words)** summarizing the type of information found.

Example points to include:
- The USB contains both **personal files** (photos, family information) and **work documents** (employee records, schedules).  
- These files may include **personally identifiable information (PII)** and sensitive business data.

### Step 3: Attacker Mindset
Think like a threat actor.  
How could an attacker use this information against Jorge or Rhetorical Hospital?  
In the **Attacker mindset** row, write **2–3 sentences (40–60 words)** explaining possible exploitation methods.

Example ideas:
- An attacker could use employee data for **social engineering** or **phishing**.  
- They could use personal details to impersonate staff or gain deeper access to the hospital’s network.  
- The USB may have been **staged intentionally** to deliver malware if plugged in.

### Step 4: Risk Analysis
Consider the risks associated with USB baiting and how to prevent such attacks.  
In the **Risk analysis** row, write **3–4 sentences (60–80 words)** describing technical, operational, or managerial controls to mitigate these risks.

Example controls to include:
- Disable USB ports on workstations or use **read-only access** for external devices.  
- Conduct regular **employee security awareness training** on handling unknown devices.  
- Implement **endpoint protection** and **malware scanning** for removable media.  
- Create strict policies separating **personal and work-related USB use**.

## What to Include in Your Submission
Your completed **Parking lot USB exercise** should include:

- 2–3 sentences describing the USB’s contents  
- 2–3 sentences explaining how the information could be used against the owner or organization  
- 3–4 sentences analyzing the risks and listing mitigation measures for USB baiting attacks
