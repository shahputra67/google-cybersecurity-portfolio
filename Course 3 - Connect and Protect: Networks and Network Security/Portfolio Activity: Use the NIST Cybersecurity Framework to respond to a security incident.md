# Incident Report Portfolio

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create an incident report using your knowledge of network security to analyze a cybersecurity event. You will apply the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to guide your analysis. The CSF provides standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.

Creating a detailed cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF demonstrates a proactive approach to managing security events, improving communication, and strengthening an organization’s overall security posture. This report can be included in your cybersecurity portfolio as evidence of your ability to analyze, document, and respond to network security incidents.

The CSF can be applied to many types of organizations and security situations. Understanding how to identify and respond to cybersecurity risks helps you determine which security measures best fit specific business needs.

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that provides web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services. The company recently experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that disrupted internal network operations for two hours.

During the incident, incoming ICMP packets flooded the company’s network, preventing normal traffic from reaching network resources. The incident response team blocked incoming ICMP packets, stopped all non-critical network services, and restored critical systems. Upon investigation, the team discovered that an unconfigured firewall allowed the attack traffic to enter the network.

To address the vulnerability, the team implemented:

- A firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets  
- Source IP address verification to prevent spoofing  
- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns  
- An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter suspicious ICMP traffic  

As the cybersecurity analyst, your task is to use this event to create a plan that strengthens network security. You will base your plan on the NIST CSF and focus on five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Incident Report Analysis Template
Use the provided incident report analysis template. You can make a copy using the provided link or download it directly.

### Step 2: Summarize the Security Event
Describe the DDoS attack, its cause, impact, and the actions taken to mitigate it. Include details about targeted systems, attack sources, and the overall effect on business operations.

### Step 3: Identify
Determine what type of attack occurred and which systems were affected. List all relevant findings in the “Identify” section of the template.

### Step 4: Protect
Assess how the organization can better protect its assets in the future. Identify which systems, configurations, or procedures need improvement to reduce future risk. Write these recommendations in the “Protect” section.

### Step 5: Detect
Explain how the organization should monitor its network for future incidents. Describe how to track unusual activity, unauthorized access, or suspicious traffic. Include your ideas in the “Detect” section.

### Step 6: Respond
Create a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents. Address how your team should contain, neutralize, and analyze attacks. Suggest ways to improve procedures for communication, evidence collection, and mitigation. Write this plan in the “Respond” section.

### Step 7: Recover
Describe the recovery process. Identify which data, systems, and services need restoration first. Explain what procedures help the organization return to normal operations quickly and securely. Add this information to the “Recover” section.

### Step 8: Save Your Work
Download and save your completed incident report analysis template. Store it in your portfolio for future reference or job applications.

## What to Include in Your Response

Your completed report should include:

- A summary of the security event  
- Identification of the type of attack and affected systems  
- A plan to protect against future cybersecurity incidents  
- Detection methods for identifying potential incidents  
- A detailed response plan for current and future incidents  
- Recovery procedures for restoring systems and operations  

## Step 9: Self-Assessment

After completing the report, perform a self-assessment by comparing your work to the provided exemplar. Answer “yes” or “no” to the self-assessment questions to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of your incident report.
