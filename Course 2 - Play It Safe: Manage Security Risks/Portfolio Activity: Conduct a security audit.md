# Portfolio Activity: Conduct a security audit

## Activity Overview

In this activity, I conducted an internal security audit to include in my cybersecurity portfolio. Audits ensure that security checks are made to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization’s business continuity and critical assets.
This task is based on a fictional company, Botium Toys, a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. As the company’s online presence expanded, its IT department faced pressure to support growing operations while maintaining compliance and security. The IT manager decided to conduct an internal audit using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to assess risks, identify vulnerabilities, and strengthen the company’s overall security posture.

## Scenario

Botium Toys operates from a single location serving as its main office, storefront, and warehouse. With its increasing online customer base, the company needs to ensure secure operations, data protection, and compliance with regulations, especially concerning online payments and E.U. business transactions.

The IT manager initiated an internal audit with the following objectives:

Establish audit scope and goals

Identify assets managed by the IT department

Perform a risk assessment

Evaluate controls and compliance against security standards

The goal of this audit is to provide an overview of the potential risks, vulnerabilities, and regulatory fines that the company might face under its current security posture.
